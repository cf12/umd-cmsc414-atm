# Attacking Other Teams' Implementations

***TBD***

## Deliverables

In your `break-it` repository, create an `analysis` directory. *All of
your files for this part must be in this directory.*

Submit a vulnerability analysis of the implementation your attacked.
This analysis should describe your attack(s), if any, at both a high
level (so someone reading it can understand what you did) *as well as*
in sufficient detail to enable someone to replicate your attack. You
can also describe any vulnerabilities you were able to find but not
exploit (due to limitation of the project); e.g., and attack that would
require multiple ATMs to connect to the bank at once. If you were unable
to find any attack, simply explain what types of exploits you looked
for. *Your vulnerability analysis should begin with name(s) of the
students whose protocol you are attacking, and a 1-paragraph summary
of what attacks (if any) you were able to find.*

Submit your vulnerability analysis via git, in the usual way. This, too,
must be typeset in a sane format (plain text or markdown, pdf, or ps).
*In your analysis, please include the team name of whose project you
are attacking.*

You should also submit (in your git repository) any code you wrote to
implement your attack. This will likely include the modified router code,
but could include any other utilities you wrote as well. Make sure to
provide details on how to use your program(s) as part of your vulnerability
analysis.

## Grading

Part 2 is worth 20 points. A successful attack (that is also described
clearly in the vulnerability analysis) will automatically be awarded 20
points. Even if you are not able to find a successful attack, you can
still get points by

 1. pointing out potential vulnerabilities that your were not able
    to successfully exploit, and/or
 2. writing a good vulnerability analysis that outlines the exploits
    you looked for and argues why they are not present in the
    implementation you were attacking.

I reserve the right to award *extra* points for multiple attacks, or
particularly clever attacks, so be creative!
